# Additional Files Analysis

## Newly Identified Files

### Command Files
1. `cc.js` - Clash of Clans related command
   - Move to: `src/commands/cc.js`
2. `ccc.js` - Related to cc.js (needs analysis)
   - Move to: `src/commands/ccc.js`
3. `delc.js` - Delete command functionality
   - Move to: `src/commands/delete-channel.js`
4. `delete.js` - Delete functionality
   - Move to: `src/commands/delete.js`

## Action Plan

1. Move Command Files
```bash
# Create backup
cp cc.js src/commands/cc.js
cp ccc.js src/commands/ccc.js
cp delc.js src/commands/delete-channel.js
cp delete.js src/commands/delete.js
```

2. Update Import Paths
- Update all require statements to use new file structure
- Update any references to these files from other modules

3. Verification Steps
- Test each command after moving
- Verify all imports work correctly
- Check for any broken dependencies

## Data Files Check
- Verify all JSON files are in correct location
- Ensure no data files are left in root directory
- Double check config file locations
