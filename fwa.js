When two war farming clans match, each side maintains easy to beat war bases. Each player uses their first attack on their mirror for either 2 or 3 stars.\n\n" +
                    "✨ FWA’s primary goal is to get **easy stars, easy wars, and easy loot 🥳**. Because of the easy base design you can 3 star any opponent’s base with no trouble!\n\n" +
                    " • Each and every war we will send a **clan mail** to inform which clan takes the win:\n" +
                    " • If we **win**, you attack your mirror (opposite number) for **3⭐**\n" +
                    " • If we **lose**, you attack your mirror for **2⭐**\n" +
                    " • For your **second attack**, you may attack the number 1 opponent for **1⭐**\n\n" +
                    "📊 On average:\n" +
                    " • Win war → ~1.5M Gold & Elixir\n" +
                    " • Lose war → ~700k Gold & Elixir\n" +
